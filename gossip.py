	instead of doing a double pass (read all lines, close file, reopen file
	to overwrite, and then re-writing specific lines) is much less RAM
	intensive. With files in the tens/hundreds of gb+ you will probably run
	out of memory with a double-pass, whereas a single-pass and replace should
	be fine. So we'll use that here :)
